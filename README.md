# Altadim: Install a Linux setup for AI developers with one command

Get a fully-configured AI developer experience with one command.
[Omakub](https://omakub.org/) is the original inspiration for Altadim.

Altadim is designed for integrated simplicity.
This means all dependencies
are consistently synchronized and pre-configured,
eliminating version conflicts and setup overhead.

Please let us know if you see ways how we could improve Altadim.

## How to install it

Start with a fresh Ubuntu install
(we recommend any Ubuntu 24.04 LTS,
[Pop!_OS' 22.04](https://system76.com/pop/download/) also works).

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadim/main/install_altadim.sh && sudo bash install_altadim.sh
```

Note: When you encounter input boxes and don't know what to select,
just stick with the already selected option.
